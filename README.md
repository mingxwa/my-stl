This is the repository of the implementation for the ISO C++ proposals I
have submitted.

The organization structure of this repository is as follows:

`./main` contains the implementation of the proposals, which are grouped
         by the related paper numbers.

`./demo` contains the demos that could run with the proposals. Each
		 `.cc` file is a standalone compile unit that could run
		 independently. To compile the `.cc` files, please use the latest
		 version of GCC, MSVC or LLVM C++ compiler, and enable C++20
		 features.
